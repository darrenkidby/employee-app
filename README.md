<strong><h2>Employee-App</h2></strong>

I created an employee app by using println.<br>
I used calculations to make it so there was a monthly salary, etc. <br>
I made a layout that was easy to read. <br>
I changed the payslip to a string, so I could add a menu bar. <br>
I added a remove and update function. <br>
I managed to figure out how to add colour as well as add bold to the console. <br>
I found a Github webpage by mgumiero9 with different Ansi codes. https://gist.github.com/mgumiero9/665ab5f0e5e7e46cb049c1544a00e29f. <br>
From there I figured out how to add them to my code using a var.
